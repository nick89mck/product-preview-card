## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main goal of this project was to try and use CSS variables and utility classes to better optimize coding and make it easier to update repeated styles without having to change them in multiple locations.

While it may not be entirely necessary for a smaller project such as this, the foundation is set if we decide to expand upon it.

### Continued development

Knowing when to style specific classes rather than styling the baseline element itself. Used a CSS Reset (https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421) with some modifications. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Used their variables and utility classes as a starting point to help wrap my head around them. Also just as a general guide on where to begin and structure the project.
